# Resizing images without distorting them

Using the seam carving algorithm, we should receive as INPUT any images that require resizing to fit in a certain frame, and output a new version of the image, fitting the frame and with no visible distortion. These images will be acquired from a public repository or taken by ourselves.

**Image processing task**: Image transformation.

**Image application**: Anywhere that needs image resizing.
